Project developed to show updated data on covid19, using ReactJS as a development framework, COVID19 Public API data APi.

I used Node-Sass for the Css files because I believe it gives me a better organization of the code and styles.
I also used shards-react for styling information cards, I believe it is a great tool for styling React codes.
And lastly I used firebase to deploy the application on the server as it is a super fast and simple tool for publishing projects.

Enjoy!
